  <h2 class='iphone-apps'>Shape Notes</h2> 
  
  <p>Shape notes are a music notation that help singers learn to associate written notes with their corresponding syllables.  For example, the notes in the above icon are &ldquo;la mi fa.&rdquo;  This is similar to the &ldquo;do re mi&rdquo; system except with only four shapes and four syllables.</p> 
  
  <p>This app is a miniature e-book with a few practice lessons and example melodies.  You can also directly move notes around to compose your own melodies.  Note that no words or sound recordings are included.  Hopefully you'll be inspired to join or start up a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp'>Sacred Harp</a> singing community in your area!</p>

  <h2 class='iphone-apps'>Per Pound,<br/> not Per Ounce</h2> 
  
  <p>Usually supermarkets show food prices by the pound, so you can compare prices without taking the weight into account.  But sometimes they show prices by the ounce.  It's confusing.  Is $.49/oz. more or less expensive than $4.99/lb.?  It's more, much more.  Some people can multiply it in their head; this app was created for everyone else.</p> 
  
  <p>With <i>Per Pound, not Per Ounce</i>, you'll see prices per ounce side by side with prices per pound.  You can enter up to three different prices to compare or rely on the existing conversion chart.</p> 
  
  <p>Note: pricing of precious metals is not supported, as they are measured with troy weight (12 ounces per pound) instead of avoirdupois weight (16 ounces per pound).</p>
