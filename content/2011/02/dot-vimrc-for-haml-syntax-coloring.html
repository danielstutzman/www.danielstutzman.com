title: dot vimrc for HAML syntax coloring
date: 2011-02-21
---
<p>Vim under Ubuntu Hardy apparently doesn't come preinstalled with syntax coloring for .haml files.  To add this, follow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1639606/how-do-i-install-a-plugin-for-vim">stack overflow</a>'s instructions.  If it still doesn't work, try adding an extra "filetype off" line as follows:</p>
<pre>set runtimepath+=~/.vim/vim-haml
filetype off
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on</pre>
