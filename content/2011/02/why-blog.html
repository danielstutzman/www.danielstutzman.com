<p>This personal blog exists for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To reveal what kind of person I am, as writing tends to do</li>
  <li>To provide technical answers discoverable by searching</li>
  <li>To give me practice at writing publicly</li>
  <li>To recommend books and online writing I enjoy to others</li>
  <li>To boost my search rankings by providing continual content updates</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't expect much in the way of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>syndicated advertising</li>
  <li>photos and videos</li>
  <li>comments</li>
  <li>editorials on world news</li>
  <li>embarrassing anecdotes</li>
</ul>
