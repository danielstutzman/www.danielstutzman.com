title: Fees for First Bank of Colorado check card
date: 2011-02-20

<p>I'm planning to leaveÂ <a href="https://www.elevationscu.com/">Elevations Credit Union</a> for <a href="http://efirstbank.com">FirstBank</a> of Colorado, since Elevations charges $7.50 a month for a business account.  FirstBank has fees too, but it looks like they're mostly avoidable, for example by keeping above a minimum balance.  The one fee that's not listed anywhere on their web site is for the Visa check card (debit card).  I emailed them and someone responded with the following info:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The annual fee for a personal Visa check card is $7.50.</li>
  <li>The charge for a business Visa check card is $1 per card per month.</li>
</ul>
