title: Stuck VMWare Fusion mouse pointer

<p>For some reason VMWare Fusion 3 gets occasionally stuck with the mouse pointer showing a little fist dragging a document with a plus symbol.  Clicking has no effect.  The only way I could find to get out of it was to drag an icon from the Mac desktop into Fusion.  Also note that keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl-W and Ctrl-Q still work, so at least you can save and exit.</p>
