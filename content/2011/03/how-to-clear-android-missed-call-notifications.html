title: How to clear Android missed call notifications
date: 2011-03-16

<p>When you push any button on an Android phone to wake it up, it shows you a screen with the time, the date, an unlock button, and sometimes a missed call notification.  To clear that missed call notification, it's not enough to pull down the drawer from the top of the screen and tap clear notifications.  The notification will still show up the next time you wake up the phone, at least for a little while after.  To clear it from the wake-up screen, you must also:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tap the phone dialer icon</li>
  <li>Tap the call log tab</li>
  <li>That's it; tap back to exit.</li>
</ol>
