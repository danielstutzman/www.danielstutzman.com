<p>So you're considering switching to Google Voice?  You can read about the features on Google's web site and tech blogs, but they might not give you the full story.  Here's my experience in digestible bullet-point form.  The good:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Having only one phone number saves people the trouble of calling both to track me down</li>
  <li>I'm notified by email about voice mail, instead of having to keep a phone on my person at all times or check it constantly</li>
  <li>Free long distance inside the U.S.</li>
  <li>Free caller ID for my land line through my cell phone</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before I got an Android phone, I had to dial an additional number to keep my outgoing caller ID number consistent.</li>
  <li>On two occasions, I missed a phone call because it never rang either phone, but I still at least got emailed</li>
  <li>Once I couldn't dial out from my Android phone with GV, but it worked when I bypassed GV</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I'm glad I switched, because it's easier for people to reach me.</p>
