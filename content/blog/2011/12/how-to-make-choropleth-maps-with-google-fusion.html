title: How to make choropleth maps with Google Fusion

<p>Choropleth maps are maps in which the regions are colored according to
some data value for that region.  For example, in the following map the U.S.
states are red if both senators from that state are Republicans, blue if both
are Democrats, and purple otherwise:</p>

  alt='Map showing party of 112th United States Congress senators by state'/>
<div style='text-align:right'><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:112th_United_States_Congress_Senators.svg'>(some rights reserved)</a></div>

I've created <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHpRisHDhH3nhejqEC_yHFtNyH6XleSzj75OerhyXnU/edit?hl=en_US'>screenshot walk-throughs</a> to show you how to create these kind of maps with free tools, either Google Fusion or GeoCommons.  I originally presented these at the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/hackshackersco/events/41541452/'>December 3, 2011</a> meeting of the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/hackshackersco/'>Colorado Hacks/Hackers</a> (journalists and technologists) group.</p>
