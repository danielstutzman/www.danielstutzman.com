title: How to automatically restart a Mac app after reboot

<p>Many Mac users probably know you can go to System Preferences -> Accounts -> Login Items and click the plus (+) button to have a certain application start itself automatically whenever the user logs in.  But how can you accomplish this programmatically?</p>
<p>A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/815063/how-do-you-make-your-app-open-at-login">Stack Overflow post</a> gives some API methods to call, but I wanted something quick and dirty that I could run from a shell script.  I settled on running <code>/usr/bin/osascript add-login.applescript</code> The file add-login.applescript is the copied from <a href="http://www.macosxautomation.com/applescript/features/system-prefs.html">a helpful AppleScript site</a>:</p>
<pre>tell application "System Events"
 get the properties of every login item
 make new login item at end of login items with properties {path:"/Applications/YourAppNameHere.app", hidden:false}
end tell</pre>
<p>It even looks like you can run this multiple times without adding more login items.</p>
