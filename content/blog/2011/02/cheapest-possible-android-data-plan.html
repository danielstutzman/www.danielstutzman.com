title: Cheapest possible Android data plan

<p>If you're like me, you're usually either close to a wi-fi connection or out doing something non-electronic.  So why pay for a 3G data plan if you'll rarely use it?  Unfortunately, that philosophy had me wandering around Denver in the cold to find an open wi-fi network to look up some crucial information.</p>
<p>Now I have an Android phone, I can get 24 hours of 3G for $1.49 via T-Mobile's Web Daypass.  It's like the emergency cell phone people get just in case they're in an accident.  Combined with T-Mobile's $0.10/minute prepaid plan for voice, a year of cell service is less than $100 for me.  But then, I tend to make calls and access the Internet from my desk; your mileage may vary.</p>
