<blockquote>"A <a href="http://jrsmith.blog.avg.com/2010/10/would-you-want-a-digital-footprint-from-birth.html">recent study</a> published by AVG, an Internet security company, found that 92 percent of American children have an online presence by the time they are 2. One third of mothers in the United States said that they had posted pictures of their newborns online, and 34 percent of American mothers had posted sonograms of their babies in the womb. According to the AVG study, American mothers are more likely to post pictures of their children online than mothers in any other country."
