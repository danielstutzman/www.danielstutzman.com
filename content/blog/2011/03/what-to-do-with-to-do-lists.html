title: What to do with to-do lists
date: 2011-03-08

<p>It's funny to look back at some of my to-do list items from years ago:</p>
<ul>
  <li>write docs for an open source project</li>
  <li>Get a Ph.D. and teach</li>
  <li>buy a house</li>
</ul>
<p>To quote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">David Allen</a>, "Boy, that was an amorphous blob of undoability!"  Unsurprisingly, I never accomplished any of the above.  Yet I'm still making lists with some fairly vague tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>comment on other blogs or guest blog</li>
  <li>make a Rails core contribution</li>
  <li>find a mentor</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, I should break down tasks into small pieces.  And usually I do.  But all those easy doable tasks tend to get accomplished and crossed off, whereas all the difficult tasks tend to survive, like natural selection.  So I've made another list below, titled <em>Reasons Why I Can't Just Do That To-Do List Item</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Because it needs more brainstorming and research first</li>
  <li>Because it needs more time to incubate</li>
  <li>Because it could use some perspective from discussion with friends first</li>
  <li>Because it requires confronting something I'm avoiding</li>
  <li>Because it can only be done during business hours, and it's too early or late now</li>
  <li>Because it's actually not necessary or important or even a good idea</li>
</ul>
<p>Who knew that a single task could be so demanding?  No wonder they're so impossible to accomplish.</p>
