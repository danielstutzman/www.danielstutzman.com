title: Boulder Startup Weekend

<p>Last weekend I attended <a href="http://boulder.startupweekend.org/">Boulder Startup Weekend</a>, which is like a two-day business plan competition.  Entrepreneurs come in with a rough idea and leave with a slick slide presentation, screenshot mock-ups, and software prototypes -- if they can attract enough volunteer consultants to their cause.</p>
<p>I joined a group that initially had no other software developers and ended up building an JavaScript mock-up of a mobile app that locates nearby businesses and collects user reviews like Yelp.  The intended market is parents traveling with young children who need places to eat, play, change a diaper, etc.  Here's a two-minute pitch video, thanks to <a href="http://www.suzanbond.com/blog/">blogger Suzan Bond</a>:</p>

<p>Ultimately I'm too risk-averse to be a startup entrepreneur like the presenters that weekend, but I'll happily support others to pursue their dreams, especially if I get to practice the craft that I enjoy.</p>
