<p>My coworker <a href="http://twitter.com/jessicardillon">Jessica Dillon</a> and I are leading one of the workshops the day before <a href="http://rockymtnruby.com/">Rocky Mountain Ruby</a> conference in Boulder, CO.  It's titled <i>Playing With Ruby</i>, it's at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, September 18, and you can read more about it on the <a href="http://rockymtnruby.com/workshop">list of workshops</a>.</p>

<p>The central idea is: instead of giving participants a bunch of parts and instructions about how to put them together, we'll give them some some working software and they can learn by tweaking.</p>
