title: Missing hooks/after_use_jruby_opts file
date: 2012-01-25

<p>After joining a JRuby project that used RVM and had an <i>.rvmrc</i> file in source control, I noticed the following error message when I <i>cd</i>'d into the project directory:</p>

<pre>chmod: /Users/dstutzman/.rvm/hooks/after_use_jruby_opts: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>So what was calling the <i>chmod</i> command and why was
  <i>~/.rvm/hooks/after_use_jruby_opts</i> missing?  It turned out that
  the problem was coming from a manual insertion made to <i>.rvmrc</i>
  recommended by <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8283300/how-do-i-use-jruby-opts-with-rvm'>a stackoverflow post</a> :</p>

<pre>PROJECT_JRUBY_OPTS=( --1.9 )
# The variable PROJECT_JRUBY_OPTS requires the following to be run in shell:
chmod +x ${rvm_path}/hooks/after_use_jruby_opts
</pre>

<p>So that explains where <i>chmod</i> command came from, but why was the
  <i>~/.rvm/hooks</i> directory present on the original developer's machine,
  but not mine?</p>

<p>The answer is that my version of RVM was older than the version the
  original developer was using.
  To update it, I followed
  <a href='http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/upgrading/'>RVM's
  upgrading instructions</a> by running <tt>rvm get latest</tt>.
  That created a <i>~/.rvm/hooks</i> directory so the error disappeared.</p>

<p>More importantly, the RVM upgrade fixed a much bigger problem:
  that JRuby was running in Ruby 1.8 mode instead of Ruby 1.9 mode.  Setting
  <i>PROJECT_JRUBY_OPTS</i> with the addition noted above
  was supposed to fix this problem, but it didn't.
  We could prove that JRuby was still running in Ruby 1.8 mode
  because running the following command using Ruby 1.9 syntax:</p>

<pre>jruby -e 'p({ a: 3 })'</pre>

<p>...produced the following error:</p>

<pre>SyntaxError: -e:1: syntax error, unexpected ':'</pre>

<p>Fortunately, upgrading RVM got <i>PROJECT_JRUBY_OPTS</i> working again,
   so running that same command was the same as running:</p>

<pre>jruby --1.9 -e 'p({ a: 3 })'</pre>

<p>...and produced the expected output:</p>

<pre>{:a=&gt;3}</pre>

<p>It would be nice if the <i>PROJECT_JRUBY_OPTS</i> code snippet would
  have tested the version of RVM and complained about it directly,
  but I suppose the <tt>No such file or directory</tt> error was better
  than nothing.</p>

<p><b>TL;DR</b> Before sharing a customized <i>.rvmrc</i>, update RVM</p>
